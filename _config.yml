  My name is Ehsan Saleh. I'm spending my time in two areas, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain.  
  Currently, I'm working on using the tricks of Adversarial Machine Learning in VQA (Visual Question Answering) system.  
  I have also been learning and developing DApps in Ethereum and Solana blockchains.  
  My goal is to do research and develop applications to make positive impacts on human society.
